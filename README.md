This is my version of "**A Random Quote Generator**" project for **Teamtreehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree**.

The task was to use basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, conditionals, and object literals to create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked.

Starter files in Commit 1 were provided, the rest of the code and files were created and added by myself.

I received an "Exceeds Expectation" grade upon submitting the project.
